100,ddos,DDOS,Combined risk,GBit/sec,1,"**Denial-of-service attack** (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack where the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.

In a distributed denial-of-service (**DDoS**) attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources â€“ potentially hundreds of thousands or more. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single IP address; plus, it is very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. There are two general forms of DoS attacks: those that crash services and those that flood services. The most serious attacks are distributed.[6] Many attacks involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP address spoofing) so that the location of the attacking machines cannot easily be identified and so that the attack cannot be easily defeated using ingress filtering.

Court testimony shows us the first demostration of DoS attack was made by Khan C. Smith in 1997 during a Defcon event disrupting Internet access to the Las Vegas Strip for over an hour and the release of sample code during the event led to the online attack of Sprint, Earthlink, eTrade, and other major corportations in the year to follow."

2,openntp,Open NTP,Vulnerable,Count,556.9,"Computers and network devices have a perversely strong need to have good agreement about what constitutes the current time (accurate precision time is critical for authentication related purposes, accurate event logging, and a host of other things). Most computers stay synchronized using Network Time Protocol (NTP). Oversimplifying greatly, NTP sets the local time by checking the time as reported by multiple trusted high-precision network-accessible clocks.

**Impact of open NTP devices**

Open NTP are amongst the most effectively mis-used DDOS amplifiers.
Just like DNS, NTP is a UDP-based service, and shares the same weaknesses that DNS does (particularly problems with spoofed traffic, traffic amplification, and unnecessarily promiscuous access to servers). It is thus hardly surprising that NTP is being abused for DDoS attacks..."
1,openrecursivedns,Open Recursive DNS,Vulnerable,Count,41,"The Domain Name System (DNS) is pervasive. Collectively, we use it billions of times a day, often without even knowing that it exists. For enterprises, it's their digital identity as well as a critical component of their security architecture. In short: DNS is pervasive and there are many DNS servers on the Internet.
Since DNS runs on the [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) protocol, it can be used for [amplification attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Reflected_.2F_spoofed_attack).

**Impact of running open recursive DNS servers**

DNS can have an amplification factor of up to 179. In other words: 1 Byte turns into 179 Bytes in DDOS traffic. If only 1000 vulnerable DNS servers in, each with a mere 10 mbit/sec connection participates in a DNS amplification DDOS attack, then the resulting DDOS size will be **1790 GBit/sec**. As a side note: the DDOS attack that brought [spamhaus down](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-ddos-that-knocked-spamhaus-offline-and-ho/) and cloudflare nearly to its knees , was a mere ~ 100 Gbit/sec."
5,openssdp,Open SSDP,Vulnerable,Count,30.8,"[SSDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol) - the Simple Service Discovery Protocol is used for advertisement and discovery of network services and presence information. It is often enabled in customer end devices (CPEs) such as modems, WLAN modems.

**Impact of running open SSDP devices**

Since SSDP runs over UDP, again, it can be used for UDP reflection attacks. **Details** SSDP's amplification factor is ~ 30. It is less powerful than NTP."
4,opensnmp,Open SNMP,Vulnerable,Count,6.3,"Simple Network Management Protocol ([SNMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol)) is an Internet-standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior. Devices that typically support SNMP include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks and more.

**Impact of running open SNMP devices**

Again, it runs on the [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) protocol and again can be abuse for UDP based [amplification attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Reflected_.2F_spoofed_attack). SNMP has an amplification factor of 6.3"
6,miraicertbr,Mirai,Infected,Count,0,"**Mirai** is malware that turns computer systems running Linux into remotely controlled 'bots', that can be used as part of a botnet in large-scale network attacks. It primarily targets online consumer devices such as remote cameras and home routers. The Mirai botnet was firstly found in August 2016 by MalwareMustDie, a whitehat malware research group, and has been used in some of the largest and most disruptive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, including an attack on 20 September 2016 on computer security journalist Brian Krebs's web site, an attack on French web host OVH, and the October 2016 Dyn cyberattack. According to a leaked chat log between Anna-senpai and Robert Coelho, Mirai was named after the 2011 TV anime Mirai Nikki."

7,openchargen,Open Chargen,Vulnerable,Count,0,"**Chargen** The Character Generator Protocol (CHARGEN) is a service of the Internet Protocol Suite defined in RFC 864 in 1983 by Jon Postel. It is intended for testing, debugging, and measurement purposes. The protocol is rarely used, as its design flaws allow ready misuse."
